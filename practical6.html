    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Maharana Pratap was a legendary Rajput king and warrior who ruled the kingdom of Mewar in present-day Rajasthan, India, during the 16th century. Born on May 9, 1540, in Kumbhalgarh Fort, he was the eldest son of Maharana Udai Singh II. Pratap is widely celebrated for his resistance against the Mughal Empire, particularly under Emperor Akbar, who sought to expand his empire into Mewar.

        Maharana Pratap is best known for his bravery during the Battle of Haldighati in 1576, where he fought against the Mughal forces led by Raja Man Singh of Amber. Though the battle was not decisively won by either side, Pratap's determination to protect Mewar's sovereignty became a symbol of resistance and patriotism.
        
        Despite facing overwhelming odds, Pratap never surrendered to the Mughals and continued to fight for his kingdom. He is also remembered for his strong leadership and commitment to his people, encouraging self-reliance and maintaining a strong military presence.
        
        Pratap died on January 19, 1597, but his legacy endures as a hero of Indian history, embodying valor, sacrifice, and the spirit of independence. His life continues to inspire generations, especially in the context of resistance against tyranny.
